//: # Hi There!
//: ## Introduction to the Introduction
//: You may be thinking "who is this person?", "what authority do they have to teach me about Swift and App development?", or "is it lunch time?"
//: Short Answers:
//: My name is Logan.
//: I have no actual authority, but doing things like this reiforce my own learning. So, in a sense, I'm just like you. Learning what I can, finding ways to implement it, how to rethink problems into functional programs.
//: Yes. It's always lunch time.
//: ### Who is this for?
//: If you are starting your journey into Swift, this is a good place to start. There are a wealth of other places, and I encourage you to check them out. I'll put the links at the bottom.
//: ### Why did I make this?
//: Because of my learning style and how my brain works. I can't read something and immediately do it. I can't follow along with a video and have the info stick. I have to do the thing. Over and over and over again. If you're the same way, then you may benefit from this.
//: For the most part, this is an outward expression of me trying to personally improve while also benefitting others.

//: ## Final Notes
//: A few quick things about me that you'll learn as you work through these modules
//: - I'm a musician and love a varity of genres, so you'll see a lot of music references through out.
//: - I'm from the south-eastern US, so you may read a few new words or usage of words that may not be familiar to and that's fine.
